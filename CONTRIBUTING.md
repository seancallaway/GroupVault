# Contributing

Welcome to the GroupVault project! We welcome your contributions in the form of bug fixes, new features, 
and documentation! When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make 
via GitHub issues before making a change.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seancallaway/GroupVault/issues) for your issue if one does 
not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - An issue is not necessary for trivial changes (described below).
* For the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  - This is usually the master branch.
  - Please avoid working on the master branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
  - Single, massive commits are less useful.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.

### Trivial Changes

For changes of a trivial nature, it is not always necessary to create a new GitHub issue. 

Changes are considered trivial is they:
* are fewer than 10 lines
* introduce no new functionality

The following things are not trivial, even if they meet the requirements above:
* a new feature
* a creative way of solving a bug
* extensive or creative comments

Examples of trivial changes include:
* correction of spelling or grammatical errors
* correction typos like the transposition of letters in a variable name
* addition of logging messages or debugging output
* changes to build or installation scripts
* reordering of imports

## Submitting Changes

* Ensure your name is added to `AUTHORS`.
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository
* Update the related GitHub issue to identify that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed.

### Tips for Getting Your PR Merged

- Write tests (and ensure your code passes all tests).
- Follow PEP8 (caveat: we use a 120 character line limit).
- Sort your imports alphabetically
- Write useful commit messages.

We will be creating a style guide at some point, but may ask you to make some changes to reflect the unwritten guide. 
Apologies in advance.
